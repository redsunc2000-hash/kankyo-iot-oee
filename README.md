# NTN IoT – Production Monitoring (OEE mock-up)

Interactive mock-up of an OEE (Overall Equipment Effectiveness) monitoring web app for **NTN Manufacturing (Thailand) Co., Ltd.**, a plant with one machine group, **Groove Machine 1**: 70 press groove machines (No.1–No.80) placed on the Plant Layout as on the customer's floor drawing. Machine data is simulated in the browser and updates every second, so the app behaves like it is connected to real machines.

Built with plain **HTML, CSS and JavaScript**. There is no framework, no build step and no backend.

## Try it

| Username | Password | Access |
|---|---|---|
| `admin` | `admin` | All modes, all assets |
| `manager` | `manager` | View mode (edit), Operation and Admin (view only) |
| `operator` | `operator` | View and Operation, Groove Machine 1 only |
| `maint.tech` | `maint.tech` | Maintenance technician: View, Operation, Machine Health and Spare Part |
| `mes.planner` | `mes.planner` | MES only: plans and releases orders, dispatch, material, product and routing |
| `mes.op` | `mes.op` | MES only: shop floor operator, Groove Machine 1 |
| `mes.qc` | `mes.qc` | MES only: inspections, NCR, lot hold and release |

After login, choose **Production Monitoring** or **MES**. The MES accounts only see the MES application, and the older roles (manager, operator, maint.tech) do not see MES. MES pages are separate menu keys in **Admin › Role** (group *MES mode*).

> These are demo accounts for a mock-up. Passwords live in the client-side code. Do not reuse this login for anything real.

## Features

- **View mode**: Overview, Plant Layout, Availability, Performance, Quality, Benchmark, Job Tracking, Loss, Alarm, Machine Detail, Machine Health, Energy, SPC, Daily Report
- **Operation mode**: Work Order and Shift Log, turn machines on/off with a reason, count Good/NG parts, edit availability/performance/quality history
- **Admin mode**: Asset (with CSV import), Role (menu + asset permissions), User, Plan Production (weekly shift + daily override), Reason, Job, Alarm rules, Sensor (limits + maintenance plan), Spare Part, Banner, Line Notify, Access Log
- **Machine Health**: press groove sensors (flywheel vibration, main motor and lubrication oil temperature, overload hydraulic pressure, power) plus room temperature, humidity and PM2.5 per machine group; health score, sensor alarms, time-to-limit prediction, PM and tool-wear counters, energy per piece, maintenance log
- **Work Order (CMMS)**: create from an alarm, Machine Health or a failed checklist item; assign, start, complete with parts used; MTBF and MTTR per machine
- **Spare Part**: stock, minimum, reserved by open work orders, receive stock; low stock shows on wear warnings
- **Energy**: kWh, TOU cost, Wh per piece, energy used while stopped, CO₂, load profile (tariff is editable)
- **SPC**: X̄-R charts of process sensors, control rules, Cpk against the warning limit
- **Shift Log**: start-of-shift checklist per machine type and shift handover notes with an automatic shift summary
- **MES** (own application and MES mode): Production Order (from product routing and BOM, material check before release), Dispatch (finite-capacity schedule with Gantt, change machine or priority), Shop Floor terminal (clock in, skill check, first-piece and final inspection, report output pre-filled from the IoT counter, lot created per report), Material & Lot (receive with supplier lot, reservations, hold, ship), Traceability (backward and forward lot genealogy to customer shipment, recall impact, machine OEE while the lot was made), Quality & NCR (disposition: rework, scrap, use as is, return), Labor (who is on which machine, skill matrix, output per hour), Product & Routing (master data)
- Live alarms (ticker, toasts, sidebar warning icons), CSV export, print to PDF
- Neumorphic white/blue theme with dark mode (theme button in the top bar)

## OEE formulas

```
Availability = Run time / Planned production time
Performance  = Actual output / Target (run time × ideal rate × cavity)
Quality      = Good parts / Actual output
OEE          = Availability × Performance × Quality
```
Planned production time comes from **Admin → Plan Production**.

## Run locally

Open `index.html` in Chrome or Edge, or serve the folder:

```bash
npx http-server -p 8080 -c-1
# then open http://localhost:8080
```

## Deploy on Render

1. Push this folder to a GitHub repository (this folder is the repo root).
2. In Render choose **New → Static Site** and connect the repository.
3. Leave **Build Command** empty and set **Publish Directory** to `.`.
4. Deploy. Every push to the main branch redeploys automatically.

You can also use **New → Blueprint**, which reads `render.yaml`.

## Notes

- Each visitor gets independent data. Settings (assets, roles, jobs…) are saved in that browser's `localStorage`. Simulated history regenerates on every page load. Super Admin can restore the defaults from the user menu: **Reset demo data**.
- LINE Notify was discontinued on 31 March 2025. The LINE screens here are simulated. A production build should use the LINE Messaging API or another channel.
- Fonts load from Google Fonts. Without internet the app falls back to system fonts.
